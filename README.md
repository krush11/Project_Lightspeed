<br/>The Lightspeed project was created specifically for Innovate NSUT hackathon. 
With vaccines being produced to restore the balance to the havoc created, the distribution and its roll-out is rather a difficult process.

This International Vaccine Distribution project deals with the transfer of the different vaccines amongst the differnet countries with heavy focus on human values and equitable distribution of available resources.
